## General Description:
Procedural Terrain Generation project for CAP 4720. This project will focus on creating a randomly generated environment using hexagons 
(as different levels of the planet) and various objects (trees, rocks, vegetation, etc.) to form a mini planet you can observe. The project 
will be built using Three.js (cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface using WebGL).
